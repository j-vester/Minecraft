Sabine

This class produces a Windspeed vector with malleable direction and speed (x and z length), and a method by which it can be added to the vectors of projectiles shot from a bow to simulate the effect of wind on their path.

Needs an initial velocity vector as input for the method, will output the combined vector.

Standard Vector methods SetX() and SetZ() can be used to change the wind speed and direction. Setting Y is overridden for this Class.
